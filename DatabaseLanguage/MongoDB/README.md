# MongoDB

## 1. 简介

MongoDB is a general purpose, document-based, distributed database build for modern application developers and for the cloud era. No database makes you more productive.

**As a programmer, you think in objects. Now your database does too.** MongoDB is a document database, which means it stores data in JSON-like documents. We believe this is the most natural way to think about data, and is much more expressive and powerful than the traditional row/column model.

**Rich JSOn Documents** The most natural and productive way to work with data. Supports arrays and nested objects as value. Allows for flexible and dynamic schemas.

**Powerful query language** Rich and expressive query language that allows you to filter and sort by any field. no matter how nested it may be within a document. Support for aggregations and other modern use-cases such as geo-based search, graph search, and text search. Queries are themselves JSON, and thus easily composable. No more concatenating strings to dynamically generate SQL queries.

**All the power of a relational database, and more...** Full ACID transactions. Support for joins in queries. Two types of relationships instead of one: reference and embedded.
